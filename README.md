# Constructures: Minecraft

A set of [constructures](https://github.com/celestriode/constructure) for Minecraft. These are used to validate input for a variety of Minecraft structures, including JSON and NBT, and provide a road to supply feedback.

Supported constructures in this very early stage currently include:

1. Text components (Java Edition)

However, all structures from data packs and resource packs are planned. Bedrock Edition will also be supported in the future.
